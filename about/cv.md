Dan Pittman
===========

Distributed systems engineer with experience in consensus, distributed execution, and technical leadership.

## About

I'm a dad and a husband who programs computers for a living.

I like learning about algebra-derivative maths and their adjacencies, programming languages, and distributed consensus. For things that don't map back to work, I like to play and study music, read fiction things, and spend nights in a tent alone or with the family as often as possible.
