### 1. [The Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)
#### The Univalent Foundations Program, Self

This is going to require the proper blog post form.  I'll link that here when it exists.

### 2. [Cornel West & Former Sanders Staffer on Movement to Draft Bernie for a New "People's Party" in U.S.](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/4/25/cornel_west_former_sanders_staffer_on)
#### Democracy Now

If I'm being honest, it pains me a little to link to DN, as they play an analgous role for the left that Fox News plays for the right, but this was "announced" on the show this morning and I haven't seen it picked up anywhere else. Go figure.
Cornel West is in this interview and per usual, he's quiet eloquent.

### 3. Invocations
#### MJ Santiago, [Witch Craft Magazine](http://www.witchcraftmag.com/)

It's probably poor form to share a picture of the page in the actual magazine, but I couldn't track down a digital copy and I'll be goddamned if this isn't premier meloncholy.

Elide the bad parts and expand the good.
