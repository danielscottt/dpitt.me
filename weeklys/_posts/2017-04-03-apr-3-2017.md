### 1. [There Is No Deep State](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/there-is-no-deep-state)
#### David Remnick, The New Yorker

To paraphrase what, exactly, the Deep State is, I'll go directly to Mr. Remnick's perspicuous description:

> Some of Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters (and, in a different, cautionary spirit, a few people on the left) have taken to using “the Deep State” to describe a nexus of institutions—the intelligence agencies, the military, powerful financial interests, Silicon Valley, various federal bureaucracies—that, they believe, are conspiring to smear and stymie a President and bring him low.

The take away from this article, however is not an ontological discourse on the Deep State, but rather, [as put in the Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/1095/fuck-the-deep-state-trump-is-the-risk), _fuck_ the Deep State:

> the problem is a shallow man—an untruthful, vain, vindictive, alarmingly erratic President. In order to pass fair and proper judgment, the public deserves a full airing of everything from Trump’s tax returns and business entanglements to an accounting of whether he has been, in some way, compromised. Journalists can, and will, do a lot. But the courts, law enforcement, and Congress—without fear or favor—are responsible for such an investigation. Only if government officials take to heart their designation as “public servants” will justice prevail.
