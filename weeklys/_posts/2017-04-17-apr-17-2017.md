### 1. [Men Recommend David Foster Wallace to Me](weeklys/_posts/2017-04-17-apr-17-2017.md)
#### Deirdre Coyle, Electric Literature

This one made its rounds through Left Twitter and reception was pretty ambivalent. Personally, It stung. I am undeniably guilty of recommending DFW to _everyone_.  The points that Coyle makes about Wallace-recommenders are spot on, and it's akin to any condescendingly boring explanation that we as men use, even if subconsciously, to exercise an intellectual superiority that in and of itself is unequivocally nonexistent beyond the space between our ears.

### 2. [The Long, Lucrative Right-wing Grift Is Blowing Up in the World's Face](http://fusion.net/the-long-lucrative-right-wing-grift-is-blowing-up-in-t-1793944216)
#### Alex Pareene, Fusion

The origin story the Fox News grandpa.

This is a fun one to intellectualize due to the adjacencies the factors which Pareene discusses as responsible for tenuous Thanksgiving dinners have with the most prevalent fears of Leftist thinkers like Foucault and Deleuze. I.e. the oppression and repression of the working class. One could argue that Fox News exists solely as a propaganda machine for the self-inflicted, but still unconscious, subjugation of scared people.

### 3. [You Are Happy?](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/you-are-happy)
#### Akhil Sharma, The New Yorker

A sad and practical story about addiction.  It's tonally plainspoken, but this is a stylistic choice; the narrator is a child whose observations are of his mother's downward spiral into alcoholism.
