### 1. [Top Democrats Are Wrong: Trump Supporters Were More Motivated by Racism Than Economic Issues](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/06/top-democrats-are-wrong-trump-supporters-were-more-motivated-by-racism-than-economic-issues/)
#### Mehdi Hasan, The Intercept
It's not just that they're wrong, it's that this polite deferral of racism accusations is a form of antintellectualism. In fact, the [Left has not been reticent](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/how-the-donald-came-to-rule/) [to call Trump and his supporters racist](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/16/watch_donald_trump_offer_irrefutable_evidence_that_he_s_definitely_not_racist.html). It is instead the politically addled _liberals_ who are afraid to offend, those who are paradoxically afraid of appearing "political".

### 2. [Capitalism is Violence](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/united-airlines-video-passenger-private-property/)
#### Matt Bruenig, Jacobin
A timely illustration drawing lines between the recent horror on an United Airlines flight and the violence of Capitalism:

> Why does the homeless man sleep in the doorway of an empty office building instead of inside the building itself? Because the police have threatened to attack him just like they attacked this airline passenger.

That said, it is important to remember that although physical violence is the most conspicuous form, the nature of Capitalism itself is violent.  In [The Violence of Financial Capitalism](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/violence-financial-capitalism), Marazzi elucidates how financial instruments such as the credit default swap and even preditory lending are _weapons of oppession_ used against the middle class.

### 3. [It's hard to laugh at Luis C.K.](https://theoutline.com/post/1367/louis-ck-netflix-special)
#### Jeff Ihaza, The Outline

> Louis C.K., whom I once considered an insightful, if absurd, philosopher, seems like too much of the wrong thing. In the context of the current mood and with the knowledge that he might be a predatory person, his style betrays something darker than mere self-deprecating wit.

I read this yesterday, I think just because it was in The Outline's daily newsletter and I'd just watched the special the night before.  Truth be told, I agree about just about all Ihaza contends, and had no idea about the accusations of predatory behavoir.
