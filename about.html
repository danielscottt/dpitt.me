title: "Hi, I'm dan."
---

<p>I'm a curious exister living in Portland, OR. I'm also a dad and a
  husband who currently programs computers for a living.</p>

<p>I like learning about algebra derivative maths and their
  adjacencies, programming languages, and distributed consensus. For
  things that don't map back to work, I like to play and study music,
  read Leftist and fiction things, and spend nights in a tent alone or
  with the family as often as possible.</p>

<p>You can find my CV <a href="/about/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Should you want to contact me you can shoot an email to <code>dan
