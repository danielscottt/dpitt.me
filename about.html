  <h3>Hi, I'm dan. I'm a curious exister living in Portland, OR.</h3>

  <img src="/images/chicken square.jpg" height="275px">

  <p>This is a picture of me with a beard.</p>

  <p>I'm a dad and a husband who currently programs computers for a living.</p>

  <p>I like learning about algebra derivative maths and their adjacencies, programming languages, and distributed consensus. For things that <i>don't</i> map back to work, I like to play and study music, read Leftist and fiction things, and spend nights in a tent alone or with the family as often as possible.</p>

  <p>Should you want to contact me you can shoot an email to <code>dan at this domain</code>.</p>
