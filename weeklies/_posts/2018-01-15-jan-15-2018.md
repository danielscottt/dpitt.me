### ["A Single Wand of Rusted Quince": On the Visionary Poetry of Bohuslav Reynek](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-single-wand-of-rusted-quince-on-the-visionary-poetry-of-bohuslav-reynek/)
#### Mike Tate / LA Review of Books

First this:

<p style="font-style: italic">
A single wand<br>
of rusted quince,<br>
furred red-blonde,<br>
wonder of scents
</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">
Forehead fragrant.<br>
A cordial kiss.<br>
Perfume flagrant —<br>
the heart feels this.
</p>

Followed by this:

> One may strain to read the first lines of “Quince on the Table” as covert political commentary on idealism turning to tyranny, with the “rust” serving as a dangerous, poisonous analogue to the deepest red of the new communist flag.

I once read that poetry freed words of their definitions, effectively unbounding meaning from semantics and causing all language to be both full of meaning while also being without it.  There's a zen to processing poetry with this in mind, and it's not a state that I have found easy to achieve.

#### Jeff Sullivan / Fangraphs

I read this entire thing and I'm not really sure why.

### [2017: Two Cents](http://reverseshot.org/archive/entry/2416/two_cents_2017)
#### Reverse Shot staff / Reverse Shot

Reverse Shot consistently has the best takes with regard to the filmic arts.  They're considerate, lyrical and erudite.  Every year, they do several retrospectives with each serving a slightly different purpose; this one is the freest of structure, with no agenda other than, well, the critics' Two Cents on the year.

Read it.

### [The RIO Monad](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/07/the-rio-monad)
#### Michael Snoyman / FP Complete

I'm in the process of prototyping some asynchronous IO stuff at work right now, and although it will not ultimately be in Haskell, I have found that when prototyping things, using Haskell results in a concise and well-typed interface.  the RIO monad, which is effectively `ReaderT a IO ()`, is a thing I'd like to refactor for.

Secondly, in regards to choosing Haskell for protoyping, it forces you to begin a project with its intial roots sowed in correctness.  Even (especially?) when the final product will _not_ be written in Haskell. In a paper called [Total Haskell is Reasonable Coq](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09286), the authors posit that the translation from a total Haskell program, that is a program with _no_ partial functions, to a Coq proof was trivial.  In fact, they wrote a tool which extracts a total Haskell program to a Coq proof. While a total program is a pretty elusive and mysterious beast, there are always critcal sections of a progam that _must_ be total, because otherwise it would fail to serve its purpose.  Having _a priori_ proof that these sections are correct before a line of production code is written is invaluable, and when prototyping in Haskell, you get this for free.
