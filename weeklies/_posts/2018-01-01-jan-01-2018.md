### [Things I Can't Solve: Multiplication](http://algassert.com/computer-science/2015/07/05/Things-I-Cant-Solve-Multiplication.html)
#### Craig Gidney / Algorithmic Assertions

A survey of fast multiplication algorithms borne out of a failed exploration towards the mystical $O(n \log n)$.

While I was at Nervana, I spent some time learning about [their work using Winograd's FIR filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09308) to reduce the asymptotic time complexity of multiplications. Now I don't pretend to understand much of it; in fact, the article above I saved with the intent to use as mitigation for this.  But, as it turns out, I don't understand much of it either.

#### Joe Scarborough / The Washington Post
Surprise, surprise! Trump probably can't read.

#### Jonathan Corbett / LWN

The first week of January was marred by the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, and this exposition is exactly the right amount of technical detail.
