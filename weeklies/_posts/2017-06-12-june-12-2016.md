> Meanwhile, the bigger and stronger the right gets, the more insular we become, single-mindedly obsessed with purifying our own ranks and weeding out the problematic among us.

This reminds me of something someone said at a DSA meeting this weekend, which I'll paraphrase: The Right has been successful in pervading all levels of the political hierarchy by starting at its roots, places like local school boards and city council seats. This is the work of the Right's activist groups, while we, on the Left instead just _talk_. We obsess over complex [speaker orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_stack) in discussions and exclude those whose disposition is not wholly pure in progressivity, all while thriving on the pedantry of Critical Theory.

This is not productive; in fact, it is counter. While the point that A'Lee Frost is pitching here is about compromise as a vehicle for success, I'd like to hitch my own trailer to that vehicle as it passes: Rhetoric alone is ineffectual. Change is precipitated through a usurping of parochial empty-heads from the ground up. Only then is this rhetoric a productive undertaking â€” because finally, there are receptive actors to reify it.
