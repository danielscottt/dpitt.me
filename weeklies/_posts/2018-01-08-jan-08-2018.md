### [Entry Level: Phil Elverum’s Inner Battle With Black Metal](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/entry-level-phil-elverum/)
#### Phil Elverum / Invisible Oranges

I spent last week in Las Vegas for CES and I came home emotionally raw.  I'm still rummaging for why, but in the meantime I read this.  I've yet to be able to make it through one track of _A Crow Looked at Me_; its weight, within seconds of the first track, is simulaneously undeniable and unbearable.

I agree with all of Elverum's takes here, about the theater of black metal in general, and the danger of making loss or pain a vehicle for extremity of image. However, there is something to be said about the catharsis of art, and he pauses on this near the end of the article:

> But it was when I heard Subliminal Genocide by Xasthur that I felt like “ah, finally.” The immediate blast of 0 to 100% was so satisfying. The scream sounded legitimately like a throat being torn open over and over, but also beautifully like howling wind. The density of the music, the full spectrum, it was balanced perfectly and there was no room for any other sound or thought. It felt like total immersion in the sound[.]

Maybe it's not all theater after all.
