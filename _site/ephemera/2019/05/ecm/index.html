         <section>
           <p>After a week of listening pretty much exclusively to American Football’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7ki5b310cwDVVJBevBLwdw?si%253DjatKDZjtQgaT45nkJGHNHw"><em>LP3</em></a>, I recalled seeing in a review of <em>LP2</em> the mentioning of their musical kinship, or maybe better put, descendance, from Steve Reich. I pulled up Reich’s compilation, <em>The ECM Recordings</em> and was immediately immersed into <em>Music For 18 Musicians</em> for my walk from the bus to the office.</p>
<p>···</p>
<h2 id="monday-it-was-actually-tuesday">Monday (It was actually Tuesday)</h2>
<p>As I’d mentioned, I started the week with Reich’s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, and by way of serendipity, I found my brain freed from the lines of code waiting to be reviewed to be acutely attuned to the music in my ears right as it reached the 33-minute mark. A Cabernet-like full body swell fills in the minuscule gaps between the percussive 16th notes looping over one another and <em>Music For 18 Musicians</em> becomes beautiful all at once.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-where-wednesday-includes-tuesday-night">Wednesday (where “Wednesday” includes Tuesday night)</h2>
<p>Okay, so, a few years ago I learned about Meredith Monk’s <em>Songs of Ascension</em> and about how it was performed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dc3mSVR3xtfU">Monk and her Vocal Ensemble occupied the spirals of Ann Hamilton’s Tower’s staircase</a> and literally ascended the stairs while performing the music of <em>Songs</em>. To watch it is to plot its beauty on all its axes, however, when only listening, one is left with merely a projection of its intention, an abstraction of its possibility.</p>
<p>It’s funny, now that I’ve watched the video again, I feel silly recapitulating my notes from my listening to this earlier this week. But nevertheless, that <strong>is</strong> why I’m doing this. I found that, without context, Monk’s music is hard to countenance. Her “vocal explorations” really push the boundary on what I can take seriously. Unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D75WFTHpOw8Y">Björk, for instance, who is course not beyond reproach in terms of seriousness-taking,</a> whose foray into vocal exploration with <em>Medulla</em> is quite palatable, insofar as any other Björk record is at least. Monk’s and Björk’s angles are, quite different, though. Monk is pushing the voice’s purpose in a piece of music while Björk’s angle is more paradoxical—her’s is to hide it by making it serve <em>all</em> purposes.</p>
<p><em>Mapping</em>, <em>Songs</em>’ sixth track, presents with Monk’s whimsical yelps and Xenakis-like percussion. It’s moments like this that this line for me, that of seriousness-taking—which, obviously, I’ve up to now been unable to give a proper title—is its most tenuous. It’s a line drawn by our experience with art, by our <em>context</em>, like, well, most anything else, really. When pondering the effects of this absence of context, I find myself imagining its opposite, i.e. to have <em>all</em> the context, about everything. Maybe this is the distinction between a binary omniscience and something more fluid, say, <em>enlightenment</em>. To know all is to never learn again, the death of creativity. I’d posit that Epicureans would say that this contextual evolution ought to be our <em>raison d’être</em> but I think it’s more visceral than that; I’d say it how we know we’re alive at all.</p>
