           <p>A few years ago, as my first foray into philosophy as a Real Adult, I attempt to power my way through Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>AntiOedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</em>. It didn’t go particularly well. I think I understood that there was something revolutionary about it, about escaping oppresive heirarchies imposed on us by the Oedipal Triangle, but the lyrical language can be, at times, nearly impossible to follow. I gave up about half-way through.</p>
<p>Last week, though, I went on tirade during a phone call with a friend about the aforementioned pair’s <em>What s Philosophy</em>, and the juxtaposition of philosophy to aesthetics. To them, philosophy is the aesthetics of <em>concepts</em>. Because I’m entitled to do so, I contributed my intrepretation of this notion: that philosophy doesn’t tell us what Is, or Should Be, but instead gives us lenses with which to view what Has, Will, or Could. Philosophy is a <strong>quiver of telescopes</strong> that we can use to view the world, discourse, existence, &amp;c.; swapping them out according to need, and adding cyclinders to the ones we use most in hopes to further their efficacy.</p>
<p>···</p>
<p>That same friend then read an article in <a href="http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/kiosk/kan-sperling_olivia_28_august_2019.php"><em>Cabinet</em></a> that mentioned “Deleuzo-Guattari Assemblage Theory”, something put forth in /AntiOedipus’/ follow up, <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>. Assemblage Theory advances the concept of flows between bodies, “desiring-production”, which is so prevalent in <em>AntiOedipus</em>.</p>
<p>(TODO: I need to explain wtf desiring production is, I can’t just say shit about “flows” and the PTFO)</p>
<p>Desiring-production by giving a name to the composites of bodies and their flows, and then a name to those composites and so on.</p>
