           <p><em>When God closes a door, he opens a window for us to jump out of.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the spring of 2013, Meg and I started attending at a small, young church in our neighborhood in East Dallas. At the time, the church’s welcome committee consisted of the music pastor and his wife who took us to dinner one evening after our third or fourth Sunday there. Meg and I had been proper parents for a little over a year—Olivia had been earth-side since February 2012—and we were on the prowl for fellow young-child-havers. It’s a strange time in a person’s life, that first year as a parent. You’re constantly reädjusting while desperately seeking consistency. When they say that becoming a parent completely uproots your existence and identity, they don’t mean that it uproots them and then re-plants them somewhere else. No, your identity is now in the bed of a truck, then maybe a train, eventually landing somewhere to be replanted long enough to take hold, to be strong enough to stand on its own, only to be uprooted again, resold to someone pushing an orange cart at a Home Depot who plans to put you in their own garden, calling you theirs, and not giving a fuck whether or not you used to play the drums in a band.</p>
<p>This church seemed to have exactly what we were looking for. In fact, this music pastor and his wife we’d observed, or at least I had, and they seemed like cool folks, which is to say they seemed like us—mirror neurons and all that. When I learned that they were the welcome committee, I almost <em>engineered</em> a meeting, saying we Were New Here with the intention to reluctantly mention that I was a drummer. As I recall, the evening went exactly as planned. Within a few weeks, I was playing drums in the band on Sunday mornings. I can remember the rehearsal for the first Sunday I played, there was a song with an front-of-the-overalls sized pocket and I was buried like week-old lint in it. He told me, “yeah, so, there’s in the pocket, and then there’s <em>in the pocket</em>… I think… you’re dragging.” He was right.</p>
<hr />
<p>Come April, and Easter, we’d begun to plan a big Easter service. When we started at the church, it met in a public elementary school’s auditorium. The school was a mid-century relic, nestled behind 100 year-old oak trees, the sidewalks cracked to the trees’ whims. The auditorium was ninety-eight per cent hardwood—the floor, the stage, the folding chairs. The other two per cent was velvet and iron, respectively hiding the unkempt borders of the stage and creakily folding the chairs, some of whom had seen their last fold. Only a few weeks before Easter, as rigid as the velvet and iron they chartered, the school district chose not renew the church’s lease, and we needed somewhere else to worship. We soon found ourselves using a different school’s auditorium, a private school’s. Its auditorium was all glass and steel and linoleum. It bordered a huge public park, one that had the tendency to flood during the Texas prairie flash-flood thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Easter is the most important holiday to a Christian. On Easter, Christ is believed to be risen from the dead, to have <em>defeated</em> death, paying for our sins and paving the way for our salvation. We’d planned to be rent out that park and have our Easter service there, with the unspoken goal that our message would be loud enough, literally, to be heard by the whole East Side. A stage was built. It was one of those rubber and steel contraptions that look like someone had disassembled a 10-story crane and re-fashioned it, tires and all, into a stage. We transported a sound board and its serpentine companion outside. I arrived on the scene at 0715—the service was at 1000—and began to unload my drums from the back of my Honda hatch-back.</p>
<p>The place was bustling. It seemed like the whole church was already there, their hands busy in service, repeatedly turning to those whose lives were objects of service, and saying, “what next?” The sun had begun to peek through a layer of Spring clouds, like it was searing a hole in them in service to God, who was determined to see what we were up to. The grass at the basin of the park glistened with dew, turning it into a field of interspersed gold and green, the sun like King Midas, turning what it could reach into precious metal. I nervously opened one drum case at time, starting with the hardware, as I’d done hundreds of times before. When I was asked, “how can I help?” all I could think to say was, where should I park my car? This resulted in my car being moved <em>for</em> me, and for my keys to no longer be on my person. Once everything was racked and secured, once I’d made all of the micro-adjustments that are necessary, I set a pair of sticks on my bass drum, a pair on my snare, and joined the ”what next?” gestalt. I was assigned a broom and I swept the cement floor of a covered picnic area.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, someone came to find me. It had begun to sprinkle a little, and they wanted to know, did I need to do anything to protect my drums. I followed them back out to the stage and we took my drums, a piece at a time, under the cover of the picnic area I’d just swept. But then, in an instant, thunder cracked the sky open and that dappling sunlight was sucked into it. A thunderstorm rolled over the park, darkened the sun-kissed grass and removed its luster like time in reverse, turning diamonds back to coal. Soon, the bottom dropped out of the storm, and sheets of water were falling from it. Time moved in reverse for us too: set up became tear down—all of the gear and the chairs and the food and the bibles were going <em>back</em> into trucks and boxes. The congregation moved as one, in perfect, ineffable synchrony, to transport our entire service back inside the school. Maybe Pastor Jeff made the call, but I didn’t hear it. It was as if all of their minds were changed in a second, like bees in a hive, and everyone knew just what to do next.</p>
<p>By 0945 we had a bare setup on stage inside the school. We’d sound checked, but I don’t remember having time to do a run-through of the set. Normally, my drums would be rear stage right and behind paneled glass to tame sound so that it may be controlled by electricity rather than left to the unpredictability of room acoustics and the inconsistency of a drummer. This time, though, I was dead-center, no shield, and dripping wet. We all were. The whole church was there, soaked to the bone in their Easter pastels and there was an electricity in the room that, before one note was played or one word was said, was already humming.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Worship music” in the modern church, particularly those that call themselves things like non-denominational or “bible churches” is a fascinating capitalist machine. The songs are, in effect, ballads, and often times are not performed, or at least <em>made famous</em> by their authors. Instead, there is an elite group of worship leaders who play these songs that are written by other lesser-known artists. What follows is that, due to the reach—which one could also interpret as <em>power</em>—that this elite group has, these songs trickle their way all the way back down to individual churches and their worship pastors in the impossible geometric configuration of an unclosed circle. The songs, as they’re on their journey, receive a number of small changes here and there; they’re perfected in their manipulative power and scrubbed clean of any ambiguity, because ambiguity is the fodder of doubt.</p>
<p>One such song that’s received this treatment is the song <em>How He Loves</em> by John Mark McMillan. McMillan is a Christian song-writer, but up until a year <em>after</em> <em>How He Loves</em> was released, operated entirely independently, entirely <em>outside</em> of the Christian music industrial complex. <em>How He Loves</em> is a heartbreaking song that McMillan wrote following the death of a close friend. It paints a picture of the indescribable power of God’s love:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When all of a sudden <br> I am unaware of these afflictions, eclipsed by glory <br> And I realize just how beautiful You are <br> And how great your affections are for me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chorus then goes on to repeat, “Whoa, how he loves us”, first at a lower octave, then later it’s belted an octave up, movingly so.</p>
<p>In second verse, McMillan sounds like he’s talking himself into his faith like so many us have following a tragedy that stands in the way of the acceptance of a benevolent God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss <br> And my heart turns violently inside of my chest <br> I don’t have time to maintain these regrets <br> When I think about the way <br> He loves us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not that tragedy makes you doubt God’s benevolence, it’s that it makes you doubt that he exists at all. God, we’re taught, is omniscient. From the logic that follows from an omniscient God one can’t help to draw the conclusion that all events are predetermined, this is how the Calvinist saw the world. On the other hand, in the face of devastation, it’s impossible to see the world as anything other than cold, impartial, and entropic. These two notions are in contradiction with one another, and when faced with a contradiction, one of the two contradictory propositions must be false. For me, it was that the ontological proposition of an omniscient God <em>must</em> be false.</p>
<p>Near the end of the song, barely able to finish the lines, McMillan mentions his friend by name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I thought about You the day Stephen died <br> And You met me between my breaking <br> I know that I still love You, God <br> Despite the agony</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s these two verses that are so powerful and so rich with emotion that make <em>How He Loves</em> what it is. To hear McMillan audibly cry about his friend and to cry out to God is to be him, to be anyone who’s suffered catastrophic loss. To feel the lines “I know that I still love you God / despite the agony” and to feel their implication, that he, at some point, asked himself the question, “Can I still love the God who lets this tragic thing happen?” These and the lines that follow contain his answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen, people, they want to tell me You’re cruel <br> But if Stephen could sing <br> He’d say it’s not true <br> ’Cause He loves us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record on which <em>How He Loves</em> appears was released independently in 2005. It spent no time on any charts, Christian music or otherwise, and, aside from <em>How He Loves</em>, is frankly unremarkable. Then, in 2009, an insider called David Crowder and his David Crowder Band recorded a cover of <em>How He Loves</em> for their release <em>Church Music</em>. <em>Church Music</em> peaked on the US Contemporary Christian Music charts at number eleven. In Crowder’s version, the last verse, the one claiming victory over doubt, is cut altogether. The line “So heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss” became “So heaven meets Earth like an unforeseen kiss” because the church cannot seem to untangle sensuousness from prurience. The frayed edges of McMillan’s broken heart had been selvedged away into marketable and unthreatening copy. I want to know McMillan’s God, but I was brought up on Crowder’s.</p>
<hr />
<p>That Sunday, we played <em>How He Loves</em>. We played it as it was meant to be played. It was the last song in the set, and the congregation was already prostrate at God’s feet, and <em>How He Loves</em> broke their hearts. When people talk about having a religious experience, this is what they mean. It’s lost time, a memory <em>of</em> but not <em>during</em>.</p>
<p>The truth is I don’t remember playing the song. There’s a 7-minute gap in my memory of that Sunday, I can remember the song being over, and the silence that fell over the room. Some were still swaying, some still had their hands in the air. I could see my ride cymbal was still vibrating, but I couldn’t hear anything. I don’t remember coming down off the stage, I don’t remember what Jeff said that day, I don’t remember talking to anyone after the service. What I’ll never forget, though, is what that minute after the song ended felt like, that ineffable synchrony, and I’m thinking now, more than 7 years later, if that’s a manifestation of God that I’ve been missing all this time.</p>
