#+TITLE: A Week of ECM

After a week of listening pretty much exclusively to American
Football's [[https://open.spotify.com/album/7ki5b310cwDVVJBevBLwdw?si%253DjatKDZjtQgaT45nkJGHNHw][/LP3/]] I recalled seeing in a review of their /LP2/ the
mentioning of their musical kinship, or maybe better put, descendance,
from Steve Reich. I pulled up Reich's compilation, /The ECM
Recordings/ and was immediately immersed into /Music For 18 Musicians/
for my walk from the bus to the office.

···

** Monday

As I'd mentioned, I started the week with Reich's /Music for 18
Musicians/, and by way of serendipity, I found brain freed from the
lines of code waiting to be reviewed to be acutely attuned to the
music in my ears right as it reached the 33-minute mark. A
Cabernet-like full body swell fills in the minuscule gaps between the
percussive 16th notes looping over one another and /Music For 18
Musicians/ becomes beautiful all at once.
