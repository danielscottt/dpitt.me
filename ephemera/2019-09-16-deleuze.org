title: A Quiver of Telescopes
---

A few years ago, as my first foray into philosophy as a Real Adult, I
attempt to power my way through Deleuze and Guattari's /AntiOedipus:
Capitalism and Schizophrenia/. It didn't go particularly well. I think
I understood that there was something revolutionary about it, about
escaping oppresive heirarchies imposed on us by the Oedipal Triangle,
but the lyrical language can be, at times, nearly impossible to
follow. I gave up about half-way through.

Last week, though, I went on tirade during a phone call with a friend
about the aforementioned pair's /What s Philosophy/, and the
juxtaposition of philosophy to aesthetics. To them, philosophy is the
aesthetics of /concepts/. Because I'm entitled to do so, I contributed
my intrepretation of this notion: that philosophy doesn't tell us what
Is, or Should Be, but instead gives us lenses with which to view what
Has, Will, or Could. Philosophy is a *quiver of telescopes* that we
can use to view the world, discourse, existence, &c.; swapping them
out according to need, and adding cyclinders to the ones we use most
in hopes to further their efficacy.

 That same friend then read an article in [[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/kiosk/kan-sperling_olivia_28_august_2019.php][/Cabinet/]] that mentioned
 "Deleuzo-Guattari Assemblage Theory", something put forth in
 /AntiOedipus'/ follow up, /A Thousand Plateaus/. Assemblage Theory
 advances the concept of flows between bodies, "desiring-production",
 which is so prevalent in /AntiOedipus/.

(TODO: I need to explain wtf desiring production is, I can't just say
 shit about "flows" and the PTFO)

Desiring-production by giving a name to the composites of bodies and
their flows, and then a name to those composites and so on.
