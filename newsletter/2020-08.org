In the spring of 2013, Meg and I started attending at a small church
plant in our neighborhood in East Dallas. The welcome committee
consisted of the music pastor and his wife, who took us to dinner one
evening after our third or fourth Sunday there. We'd been proper
parents for a little over a year—Olivia had been earth-side since
February 2012—and were on the prowl for fellow
young-child-havers. It's a strange time in a person's life, that first
year as a parent. You're constantly readjusting while desparately
seeking some consistency. When they day that becoming a parent
completely uproots your existence and identity, they don't mean uproot
them, and then replant them somewhere else. No, your identity is now
in the bed of a truck, then maybe a train, eventually landing
somewhere to be replanted long enough to take hold, to be strong
enough to stand on its own, when it's uproot again, resold to en masse
to someone pushing an orange cart at a Home Depot who plans to put you
in their own garden, calling you theirs, and not giving a fuck whether
or not “you used to play the drums in a band”.

This church seemed to have exactly what we were looking for. In fact,
this music pastor and his wife we'd observed, or at least I had, and
we were interested in taking the next step. When I learned that they
were the welcome committee, I almost engineered a meeting, saying we
Were New Here, with intention to reluctantly mention that I was a
drummer. As I recall, the evening went exactly as planned. Within a
few weeks, I was playing drums in the band on Sunday mornings. I can
remember the rehearsal for the first Sunday I played, there was a song
with an front-of-the-overalls sized pocket and I was buried like
week-old lint in it. He told me, “yeah, so, there's in the pocket, and
then there's /in the pocket/… I think… you're dragging.” He was right.

Come April, and Easter, we'd begun to plan a big Easter service. When
we started at the church, we met in a public elementary school's
auditorium. The school was a midcentury relic, nestled behind 100
year-old oak trees, the sidewalks cracked to the tree's whims. The
auditorium was 98% hardwood. The floor, the stage, the folding
chairs. The other two per cent was velvet and iron, respectively
hiding the unkept borders of the stage and creakily folding the
chairs, some of whom had seen their last fold. As rigid as the velvet
and iron they chartered, the district did not renew the church's
lease, and we needed somewhere else to worship. We found ourselves
using another school's auditorium, a private school, this one all
glass and steel with linoleum floors, it shared a side with a huge
public park, one that had the tendency to flood during the Texas
prarie flash-flood thunderstorms.

So, Easter. Easter is the most important to a christian. On Easter,
Christ is believed to be risen from the dead, to have /defeated/
death, paying for our sins and paving the way for our
salvation. Easter Sundays are therefore the /most/ important of the
Sundays. We'd planned to be rent out the large public park and have
our Easter service there, for our message to be loud enough,
literally, to be heard by the whole East Side. A stage was built. One
of those rubber and steel contraptions that look like someone'd
disassembled a 10-story crane and refashioned it, tires and all, into
a stage. We transported a sound board and its serpent companion
outside. I arrived on the scene at 0715—the service was at 1000—and
began to unload my drums from the back of my Honda hatchback.

The place was bustling. It seemed like the whole church was already
there, their hands busy in service, repeatedly turning to those whose
lives were objects of service, and saying, “what next?” The sun had
begun to peek through a layer of Spring clouds, like it was searing a
hole in them, determined to see what we were up to. The grass at the
basin of the park glistened with dew, turning it into a field of
interspersed gold and green, the sun like king midas, turning what it
could reach into precious metal.
