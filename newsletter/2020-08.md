_When God closes a door, he opens a window for us to jump out of._

<!--more-->

In the spring of 2013, Meg and I started attending at a small, young
church in our neighborhood in East Dallas. At the time, the welcome
committee consisted of the music pastor and his wife who took us to
dinner one evening after our third or fourth Sunday there. Meg and I
had been proper parents for a little over a year—Olivia had been
earth-side since February 2012—and were on the prowl for fellow
young-child-havers. It's a strange time in a person's life, that first
year as a parent. You're constantly reädjusting while desparately
seeking consistency. When they say that becoming a parent completely
uproots your existence and identity, they don't mean that it uproots
them and then replants them somewhere else. No, your identity is now
in the bed of a truck, then maybe a train, eventually landing
somewhere to be replanted long enough to take hold, to be strong
enough to stand on its own, only to be uprooted again, resold to
someone pushing an orange cart at a Home Depot who plans to put you in
their own garden, calling you theirs, and not giving a fuck whether or
not you used to play the drums in a band.

This church seemed to have exactly what we were looking for. In fact,
this music pastor and his wife we'd observed, or at least I had, and
they seemed like cool folks, which is to say they seemed like
us—mirror neurons and all that. When I learned that they were the
welcome committee, I almost _engineered_ a meeting, saying we Were New
Here with the intention to reluctantly mention that I was a
drummer. As I recall, the evening went exactly as planned. Within a
few weeks, I was playing drums in the band on Sunday mornings. I can
remember the rehearsal for the first Sunday I played, there was a song
with an front-of-the-overalls sized pocket and I was buried like
week-old lint in it. He told me, “yeah, so, there's in the pocket, and
then there's _in the pocket_… I think… you're dragging.” He was right.

Come April, and Easter, we'd begun to plan a big Easter service. When
we started at the church, we met in a public elementary school's
auditorium. The school was a midcentury relic, nestled behind 100
year-old oak trees, the sidewalks cracked to the trees' whims. The
auditorium was ninety-eight per cent hardwood—the floor, the stage,
the folding chairs. The other two per cent was velvet and iron,
respectively hiding the unkept borders of the stage and creakily
folding the chairs, some of whom had seen their last fold. Only a few
weeks before, as rigid as the velvet and iron they chartered, the
district did not renew the church's lease, and we needed somewhere
else to worship. We soon found ourselves using a different school's
auditorium, this one a private school. Its auditorium was all glass
and steel and linoleum. It bordered a huge public park, one that had
the tendency to flood during the Texas prarie flash-flood
thunderstorms.

Easter is the most important holiday to a christian. On Easter, Christ
is believed to be risen from the dead, to have _defeated_ death,
paying for our sins and paving the way for our salvation. We'd planned
to be rent out that park and have our Easter service there, with the
unspoken goal that our message would be loud enough, literally, to be
heard by the whole East Side. A stage was built. It was one of those
rubber and steel contraptions that look like someone had disassembled
a 10-story crane and refashioned it, tires and all, into a stage. We
transported a sound board and its serpent companion outside. I arrived
on the scene at 0715—the service was at 1000—and began to unload my
drums from the back of my Honda hatchback.

The place was bustling. It seemed like the whole church was already
there, their hands busy in service, repeatedly turning to those whose
lives were objects of service, and saying, “what next?” The sun had
begun to peek through a layer of Spring clouds, like it was searing a
hole in them in service to God, who was determined to see what we were
up to. The grass at the basin of the park glistened with dew, turning
it into a field of interspersed gold and green, the sun was like King
Midas, turning what it could reach into precious metal. I nervously
opened one drum case at time, starting with the hardware, as I'd done
hundreds of times before. When I was asked, “how can I help?” all I
could think to say was, where should I park my car? This resulted in
my car being moved _for_ me, and for my keys to no longer be on my
person. Once everthing was racked and secured, once I'd made all of
the micro-adjustments that are necessary, I set a pair of sticks on my
bass drum, a pair on my snare, and joined the ”what next?” gestalt. I
was assigned a broom and I swept the cement floor of a covered pinic
area.

A few minutes later, someone came to find me. It had begun to sprinkle
a little, and they wanted to know, did I need to do anything to
protect my drums. I followed them back out to the stage and we took my
drums, a piece at a time, under the cover of the picnic area I'd just
swept. Then, in an instant, thunder cracked the sky open, and that
dappling sunlight was sucked into it. A thunderstorm rolled over the
park, darkened the sun-kissed grass and removed its lustre like time
in reverse, turning diamonds back to coal. Soon, the bottom dropped
out of the storm, and sheets of water were falling from it. Time moved
in reverse for us too: set up became tear down—all of the gear and the
chairs and the food and the bibles were going /back/ into trucks and
boxes. The congregation moved as one, in perfect, ineffable synchrony,
to transport our entire service back inside the school. Maybe Pastor
Jeff made the call, but I didn't hear it. It was like all of their
minds were changed in a second, like bees in a hive, and everyone just
knew what to do next.

By 0945 we had a bare setup on stage inside the school. We'd sound
checked, but I don't remember having time to do a run-through of the
set. Normally, my drums would be rear stage right and behind paneled
glass to tame sound so that it may be controlled by electricity rather
than face the unpredictability of acoustics and the inconsistency of a
drummer. This time, though, I was dead-center, no shield, and dripping
wet. We all were. The whole church was there, soaked to the bone in
their Easter pastels and there was an electricity in the room that,
before one note was played or one word was said, was already humming.

“Worship music” in the modern church, particularly those that call
themselves things like non-denominational or “bible churches” is a
fascinating capitalist machine. The songs are, in effect, ballads, and
often times are not performed, or at least _made famous_ by their
authors. There is an elite group of worship leaders who play these
songs, often written by other lesser-known artists. Then, due to the
reach—which one could also intepret as _power_—that this elite group
has, these songs trickle their way all the way back down to individual
churches and their worship pastors in the impossible geometric
configuration of an unclosed circle. The songs, as they're on their
journey, receive a number of small changes here and there; they're
perfected in their manipulative power and scrubbed clean of any
ambiguity, because ambiguity is the fodder of doubt.

One such song that's received this treatment is the song _How He
Loves_ by John Mark McMillan. McMillan is a christian songwriter, but
up until a year _after_ _How He Loves_ was released, operated entirely
independently, entirely _outside_ of the christian music industrial
complex. _How He Loves_ is a heartbreaking song that McMillan wrote
following the death of a close friend. It paints a picture of the
indescribable power of God's love:

> When all of a sudden
> I am unaware of these afflictions, eclipsed by glory
> And I realize just how beautiful You are
> And how great your affections are for me

The chorus then goes on to repeat, “Whoa, how he loves us”, first at a
lower octave, then later it's belted an octave up, movingly so.

In second verse, McMillan sounds like he's talking himself in his
faith, like so many us do following a tragedy that stands in the way
of the acceptance of a benevalent God.

> So heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss
> And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
> I don't have time to maintain these regrets
> When I think about the way
> He loves us

It's not that tragedy makes you doubt God's benevalence, it's that it
makes you doubt that he exists at all. God, we're tought, is
omniscent. The logic that follows from an omniscient god is that all
events are predetermined. In the face of devestation, it's impossible
to see the world as cold, impartial and entropic. This is an obvious
contradiction, and when faced with a contradiction, one of the two
contradictory propositions must be false. That is, the ontological
proposition of an omnscient God must be false.

Near the end of the song, barely able to finish the lines, McMillan
mentions his friend by name.

> Oh, I thought about You the day Stephen died
> And You met me between my breaking
> I know that I still love You, God
> Despite the agony

It's these two verses that are powerful, so rich with emotion, that
make _How He Loves_ what it is. To hear McMillan audibly cry about his
friend and to cry out to God is to be him, to be anyone who's suffered
catastrophic loss. To feel lines “I know that I still love you God /
despite the agony” and their implication, that he at some point, asked
himself the question, “Can I still love the God who lets this tragic
thing happen?” These and the following lines contain his answer.

> Listen, people, they want to tell me You're cruel
> But if Stephen could sing
> He'd say it's not true, 'cause
> 'Cause He loves us

The record containing _How He Loves_ was released independently
in 2005. It spent no time on any charts, christian music or otherwise,
and, aside from _How He Loves_, is frankly unremarkable. Then, in
2009, an insider called David Crowder and his David Crowder Band did a
cover of _How He Loves_ on their release _Church Music_. _Church
Music_ peaked on the US CCM charts at number eleven. In Crowder's
version, the last verse, the one claiming victory over doubt, is cut
altogether. The line “So heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss”
became “So heaven meets Earth like an unforseen kiss” because the
church cannot seem to untangle sensousness from prurience. The frayed
edges of McMillan's broken heart had been selvedged away into
marketable and unthreatening copy.
