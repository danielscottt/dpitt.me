### Hi, I'm dan. I'm a curious exister living in Portland, OR.

![I'm eating chicken tenders](/images/chicken square.jpg){:height="250px"}

This is a picture of me with a beard.

I'm a dad and a husband who currently programs computers for a living.

I like learning about algebra derivative maths and their adjacencies, programming languages, and distributed consensus. For things that _don't_ map back to work, I like to play and study music, read Leftist and fiction things, and spend nights in a tent alone or with the family as often as possible.

Should you want to contact me you can shoot an email to `dan at this domain`.
